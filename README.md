The project folder contains the following files:

Home.html -> home page for the web app

src -> source code;

lib -> javascript frameworks;

css -> styles;

Run Home.html to execute the application.

Please use Firefox or Internet Explorer to run it because Chrome or Safari don't let you load web workers when running scripts from a local file. In a real case scenario, there shall be a web server for request from HTTP protocol Instead of local file.
